	<h3>Problem 6</h3>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
	<p>1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385</p>
	<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
	<p>(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025</p>
	<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.</p>
	<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>
